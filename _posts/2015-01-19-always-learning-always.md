There is been a while that I am always reading and studying and play a little while with Ionic Framework.
But these days I tried to create a small and simple app faster as I can, and I discover that just the study is not enough,
you need to put your hands deep on the code to learn what we call here in Brazil "cat's jump" (The little tricks) about the
tool you are using. Here I will discribe small things you need to practice to learn faster these tricks.

##First: Study, off course.

If you think that just start coding like a lunatic will make you learn everything faster and better I just have one thing to
tell you: "YOU ARE TOTALLY WRONG!". You need to learn before code.

Everybody thought that if you need to focus on syntax and learn like a robot is the right way. For me this doesn't work, but what I
did that really gave me great knowledge to code faster with AngularJS and Ionic was understand the basics of the technology architechture
about the tool you are using, no matter what is, could be a new Programming language, a new Framework (like was for me), new lib, whatever...If
you have the bases about it you will solve your little problems faster.

##Second: If you think you are the master about that, the docs will show you that you are far from be that

Don't waste your time trying to discover how to make something works changing the code and see if you guessed right. STOP THAT. You are not
Patrick Jane or some kind of Psychic medium or anything like that. Put your honor by side and open the docs, read it, see what you want, read
how to make it works.

There are some new programmers that don't give the right value to documentation, don't be like them.

##Third: Don't be Insane

The basic concept of insanity is trying to do the same thing, again, and again, and again expecting different results. If your code is not working
it's because the way you did is wrong, just simple like that, don't be ashame, I do this everytime, your code will never be perfect and for sure will
not be right on the first time you are working with a new stuff. And when this happens don't be like a dog running to catch his own tail, what I wanna
say is don't change the code, change your way of thinking about it cause it's not the right way this new framework works, or new technology, go back to the
first lesson right above.

And don't waste your time refreshing the page expecting the things will work just like magic, this is insanity.

##Fourth: Trace a goal and don't stop until you got it

Everyday when you code a little while in a project trace a goal, this is very good cause make you feel happy and honor about yourself when you reach it.
I do that everyday, when I was working with another Ionic app I did this and works a lot with me. Start with small goals like, create the REST API Client Service
of the App or create the CRUD of this part of the app with the local device database. And when you feel more secure with yourself try to reach more complex goals.

At the end of your coding time you will have the good sensation that you did your job.

##Fifth: Use git

Don't ask, just use it.

##Sixth: Take a break sometimes

It's normal that somedays or sometimes you burnout, you are blocked, when this happens just close your Macbook and do anything different that makes you mind free,
play soccer, play video game, play guitar, prepare something to eat, anything you want, just don't open your Macbook again for while. Sometimes you will find the
solution about that problem when never expected, sometimes I found the solution about some code problem when I was at shower or cooking or running.

Well, these are my 6th lessons that I learned working with Ionic and Hybrid Development, hope you like it.
