Hello World! My name is Matheus and I am a developer, love code, love to see the user
happy when it is using something that I created, that's me, that's who I am.

And now I created this blog cause I always felt like I need to tell everybody about my
new discoveries on programming world. On these days I was loving to play and mix with
mobile development, creating apps and everything about it. It's great when you see your
app working on your mobile device (smartphone, tablet, whatever) gives you a great
feeling. And I think this will be my path for a long time from now.

So I started this blog to help everyone that's starting on this world and need some help.
Now I am coding a lot with hybrid development for mobile using cordova and some frameworks
basically Ionic now, and here I will try to write some tutorials, tips and other interesting
things about the hybrid mobile development.

Hope I can always bring new stuffs for you guys (and ladies) and we can exchange experiencies.

Seeya!
